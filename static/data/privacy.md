### Introduction

Lime - HighTech Solutions s.r.o. (“us,” “we,” or “Lime”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of our customers (“Customers”) and their end users (“End Users”), as well as other users of the Lime mobile cloud services (“Services”) and the Lime websites, including http://getlime.io, http://lime-company.eu and any successor sites (collectively, “Websites” and each individually, a “Website”). We created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to give you confidence as you use the Services and Websites, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Services and Websites, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Services Websites or any websites of the partners or Customers of Lime, each of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Websites and certain aspects of the Services are governed by this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which our Customer has engaged Lime.

### Traffic Data Collected

When you visit the Websites, web servers collect information about your visit (known as “traffic data”), which is stored as anonymous, aggregate data. We use traffic data to learn more about visitors’ use of the Websites and to improve the quality of the content and functionality of the Websites, as well as to target our offerings to the people most interested in them based on their use of the Websites. In order to provide the Services to our Customers, Lime collects certain information and data about End Users that is sent to our servers from one of the Lime “Client Libraries” that may be integrated into our Customers’ mobile application(s) (“End User Information”). Lime provides analyses of anonymized, aggregate End User Information to its Customers and to other third parties (“Analyzed Data”). Lime takes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Analyzed Data does not include any PII, as defined below

### Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information (“PII”) is information that can be used to identify an individual user, for example, a person’s name, home address, email address or phone number. We also collect billing information such as credit card number. We receive and store any PII users enter on our Websites, send to us in an email or voluntarily provide to us in any other way.

### PII Collected for Website Registration

In order for you to access certain areas of the Websites or use certain features of the Services, we may require you to provide us with certain PII, such as your name, phone number and e-mail address (“Personal Information”). You may also provide Lime with certain optional information at your sole discretion (“Optional Information”). For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, all Optional Information that you provide us will be deemed Personal Information.

Use of Personal Information Collected on the Websites
The use of Personal Information collected through our Websites shall be limited to the purposes of providing the service for which you have engaged Lime, such as personalizing the service, to process payment and communicating with you about the service.

### PII Collected via the Services
Use of the Services does not require that Lime’ customers provide to Lime, and Lime requests that its Customers do not provide to it, any PII relating to their End Users. End Users should be aware, however, that Lime’ Customers may request such information from End Users in order to use their mobile applications and such PII may be included in the End User Information provided to Lime. End Users should therefore review the privacy policies of the mobile applications they use to assess the security of any PII they disclose. To the extent Lime does receive any PII as part of the End User Information, Lime shall make reasonable efforts, consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy, to maintain the confidentiality of such PII.

## Log Files

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve marketing, analytics, and site functionality.

## Cookies and Tracking technologies

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Lime and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and marketing service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use cookies to remember users’ form submitted information. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.

Our Website includes social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button and widgets, such as the “share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policies of the company providing them.

## HTML5 LSO

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 local storage and cookies to store form submitted information. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 to collect and store information.

Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.

### Information Sharing

Lime does not rent, sell or share PII, including your Personal Information, with any third parties except in the following limited circumstances:

- We have your express consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any Personal Information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted business partners (“Partners”) for the purpose of processing Personal Information or Analyzed Data on our behalf, but only to provide the requested Services and subject to this Privacy Policy. Such Partners shall be bound to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations to Lime and to provide your requested Services.
- If Lime is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.

### Confidentiality and Security

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless we believe in good faith that disclosure of your Personal Information or any other information we collect about you is necessary to: (1) comply with a court order or other legal process; (2) protect the rights, property or safety of Lime or another party; (3) enforce our Terms of Use; or (4) respond to claims that any posting or other content violates the rights of third parties.

### Information Security and Data Integrity

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. Although we make good faith efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, you should understand that there is no such thing as complete security, and we do not guarantee that there will be no unintended disclosures of your Personal Information. If we become aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law. When you enter Sensitive Information (such as credit card number and log in credentials) on our site, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

### Lost or Stolen Information

You must promptly notify us if your Personal Information is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that Personal Information from your account and update our records accordingly.

### Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any change in how we use your Personal Information we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

### Controlling Your Personal Information

As a registered user of the Websites, you can modify or delete some of the Personal Information you have included in your profile by logging in and accessing your account. You cannot, however, change your username once you have registered.

We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
